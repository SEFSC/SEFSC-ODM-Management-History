# Management History Processing Project

This SEFSC - ODM - Management History repository provides a method for generating an analysis-ready version of the Management History Database. In their original format, the records in this database represent changes in management actions affecting federally managed species throughout the Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic, and U.S. Caribbean regions. The data files and code contained in this repository define and execute logic for grouping and creating streamlined time series of related management events. This process is actively being updated. Draft metadata can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P229OLxEG_iIS31VEbKlKiW2jmiFPKfn5N9Vr9xG4dM/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs).

## code/
This folder contains the standard processing code for generating an analysis-ready dataset. The metadata for this code can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXv0kkcQRFgHativf3xW3v7-eQLyTDvb/edit#).
